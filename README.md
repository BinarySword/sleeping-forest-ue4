This is a `visual studio code extension` meant to be run along-with Unreal Engine 4 projects.

### Motivation
---
When I first started out with Unreal Engine 4, I had a cheap laptop with 4GB RAM and 15W processor. Many times, I would have coffee time while my projects compile.
I have first-hand experience with pumping out as much performance as possibly by tweaking config files and following performance rules closely.
Since then, I have improved a lot as a developer. But something I have not forgotton is the pleasure of FINALLY scavenging out snippets from 5 years ago in forums and the pain of seeing my RAM burning out while my intellisense is dead or something.
So here's a **truckload!!!** of snippets, gimmicks and convenience tools.

By a lazy developer, for lazy developers !!!
